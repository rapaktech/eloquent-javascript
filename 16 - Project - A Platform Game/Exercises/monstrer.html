    /* A monster
    It is traditional for platform games to have enemies that you can jump on top
    of to defeat. This exercise asks you to add such an actor type to the game.
    We’ll call it a monster. Monsters move only horizontally. You can make
    them move in the direction of the player, bounce back and forth like horizontal
    lava, or have any movement pattern you want. The class doesn’t have to handle
    falling, but it should make sure the monster doesn’t walk through walls.
    When a monster touches the player, the effect depends on whether the player
    is jumping on top of them or not. You can approximate this by checking
    whether the player’s bottom is near the monster’s top. If this is the case, the
    monster disappears. If not, the game is lost. */
