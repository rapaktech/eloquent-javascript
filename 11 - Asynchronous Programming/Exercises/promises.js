/* Building Promise.all
Given an array of promises, Promise.all returns a promise that waits for all of
the promises in the array to finish. It then succeeds, yielding an array of result
values. If a promise in the array fails, the promise returned by all fails too,
with the failure reason from the failing promise.
Implement something like this yourself as a regular function called Promise_all
.
Remember that after a promise has succeeded or failed, it canâ€™t succeed or
fail again, and further calls to the functions that resolve it are ignored. This
can simplify the way you handle failure of your promise. */
