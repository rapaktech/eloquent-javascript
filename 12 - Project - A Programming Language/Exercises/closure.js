/* Closure
The way we have defined fun allows functions in Egg to reference the surrounding scope, allowing the function’s body to use local values that were visible at
the time the function was defined, just like JavaScript functions do.
The following program illustrates this: function f returns a function that
adds its argument to f’s argument, meaning that it needs access to the local
scope inside f to be able to use binding a.
run(`
do(define(f, fun(a, fun(b, +(a, b)))),
print(f(4)(5)))
`);
// → 9
Go back to the definition of the fun form and explain which mechanism
causes this to work.
