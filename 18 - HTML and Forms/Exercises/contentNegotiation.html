    /* Content negotiation
    One of the things HTTP can do is called content negotiation. The Accept
    request header is used to tell the server what type of document the client
    would like to get. Many servers ignore this header, but when a server knows of
    various ways to encode a resource, it can look at this header and send the one
    that the client prefers.
    The URL http://eloquentjavascript.net/author is configured to respond with
    either plaintext, HTML, or JSON, depending on what the client asks for. These
    formats are identified by the standardized media types text/plain, text/html,
    and application/json.
    Send requests to fetch all three formats of this resource. Use the headers
    property in the options object passed to fetch to set the header named Accept
    to the desired media type.
    Finally, try asking for the media type application/rainbows+unicorns and
    see which status code that produces. */
