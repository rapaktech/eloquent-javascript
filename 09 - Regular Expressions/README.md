# Regular expressions are objects that represent patterns in strings. They use their own language to express these patterns

* /abc/ A sequence of characters
* /[abc]/ Any character from a set of characters
* /[^abc]/ Any character not in a set of characters
* /[0-9]/ Any character in a range of characters
* /x+/ One or more occurrences of the pattern x
* /x+?/ One or more occurrences, nongreedy
* /x*/ Zero or more occurrences
* /x?/ Zero or one occurrence
* /x{2,4}/ Two to four occurrences
* /(abc)/ A group
* /a|b|c/ Any one of several patterns
* /\d/ Any digit character
* /\w/ An alphanumeric character (“word character”)
* /\s/ Any whitespace character
* /./ Any character except newlines
* /\b/ A word boundary
* /^/ Start of input
* /$/ End of input

A regular expression has a method test to test whether a given string
matches it. It also has a method exec that, when a match is found, returns
an array containing all matched groups. Such an array has an index property
that indicates where the match started.

Strings have a match method to match them against a regular expression
and a search method to search for one, returning only the starting position
of the match. Their replace method can replace matches of a pattern with a
replacement string or function.

Regular expressions can have options, which are written after the closing
slash:

* The i option makes the match case insensitive.
* The g option makes the expression global, which, among other things, causes the replace method to replace all instances instead of just the first. The y option makes it sticky, which means that it will not search ahead and skip part of the string when looking for a match.
* The u option turns on Unicode mode, which fixes a number of problems around the handling of characters that take up two code units.

Regular expressions are a sharp tool with an awkward handle. They simplify some tasks tremendously but can quickly become unmanageable when applied to complex problems. Part of knowing how to use them is resisting the urge to try to shoehorn things that they cannot cleanly express into them.
