/* When you put a plus sign (+) after something in a regular expression, it
indicates that the element may be repeated more than once. Thus, /\d+/
matches one or more digit characters. */

console.log(/'\d+'/.test("''"));

/* The star (*) has a similar meaning but also allows the pattern to match zero
times. Something with a star after it never prevents a pattern from matching—
it’ll just match zero instances if it can’t find any suitable text to match. */

console.log(/'\d*'/.test("'123'"));
// → true
console.log(/'\d*'/.test("''"));

/* A question mark makes a part of a pattern optional, meaning it may occur
zero times or one time. In the following example, the u character is allowed to
occur, but the pattern also matches when it is missing. */

console.log(neighbor.test("neighbour"));
// → true
console.log(neighbor.test("neighbor"));
// → true


/* To indicate that a pattern should occur a precise number of times, use braces.

Putting {4} after an element, for example, requires it to occur exactly four
times. It is also possible to specify a range this way: {2,4} means the element
must occur at least twice and at most four times.

Here is another version of the date and time pattern that allows both single and double-digit days, 
months, and hours. It is also slightly easier to decipher. */
