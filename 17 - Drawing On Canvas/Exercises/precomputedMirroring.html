    /* Precomputed mirroring
    One unfortunate thing about transformations is that they slow down the drawing of bitmaps.
    The position and size of each pixel has to be transformed, and
    though it is possible that browsers will get cleverer about transformation in
    the future, they currently cause a measurable increase in the time it takes to
    draw a bitmap.

    In a game like ours, where we are drawing only a single transformed sprite,
    this is a nonissue. But imagine that we need to draw hundreds of characters
    or thousands of rotating particles from an explosion.
    Think of a way to allow us to draw an inverted character without loading
    additional image files and without having to make transformed drawImage calls
    every frame. */
