    /* Shapes
    Write a program that draws the following shapes on a canvas:
    1. A trapezoid (a rectangle that is wider on one side)
    2. A red diamond (a rectangle rotated 45 degrees or ¼π radians)
    3. A zigzagging line
    4. A spiral made up of 100 straight line segments
    5. A yellow star

    When drawing the last two, you may want to refer to the explanation of
    Math.cos and Math.sin in Chapter 14, which describes how to get coordinates
    on a circle using these functions.

    I recommend creating a function for each shape. Pass the position, and
    optionally other properties such as the size or the number of points, as parameters. 
    The alternative, which is to hard-code numbers all over your code, tends
    to make the code needlessly hard to read and modify. */
