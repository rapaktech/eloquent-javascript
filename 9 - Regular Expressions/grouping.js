/* To use an operator like * or + on more than one element at a time, you have to
use parentheses. A part of a regular expression that is enclosed in parentheses
counts as a single element as far as the operators following it are concerned. */



let cartoonCrying = /boo+(hoo+)+/i;
console.log(cartoonCrying.test("Boohoooohoohooo"));
// â†’ true



/* The first and second + characters apply only to the second o in boo and hoo,
respectively. The third + applies to the whole group (hoo+), matching one or
more sequences like that.
The i at the end of the expression in the example makes this regular expression case insensitive, allowing it to match the uppercase B in the input string,
even though the pattern is itself all lowercase. */
