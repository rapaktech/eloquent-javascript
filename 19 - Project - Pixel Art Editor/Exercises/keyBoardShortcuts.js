/* Keyboard bindings
Add keyboard shortcuts to the application. The first letter of a tool’s name
selects the tool, and control-Z or command-Z activates undo.
Do this by modifying the PixelEditor component. Add a tabIndex property
of 0 to the wrapping <div> element so that it can receive keyboard focus. Note
that the property corresponding to the tabindex attribute is called tabIndex,
with a capital I, and our elt function expects property names. Register the key
event handlers directly on that element. This means you have to click, touch,
or tab to the application before you can interact with it with the keyboard.
Remember that keyboard events have ctrlKey and metaKey (for the command key on Mac) 
properties that you can use to see whether those keys are held down. */
