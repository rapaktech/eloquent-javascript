# This is a repository documenting my progress on my way to mastering JavaScript, using the Eloquent JavaScript textbook by Marijn Haverbeke

**Each folder represents work done for each chapter completed in the book, an each contains a subfolder labelled "Exercises",  
where I included my code solutions for the programming problems outlined at the end of each chapter.**

**The aim is that by the end of the book, I would have mastered the ECMAScript Language Specification and how to solve problems using it,  
as well as master th basic principles to algorithmic thinking and translating algorithms to code**
